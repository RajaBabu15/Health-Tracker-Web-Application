## 

This project provides a web-based application to track and manage your mental health. It leverages various technologies to offer a comprehensive solution:

* **Machine Learning:** Analyzes data to potentially predict mental health concerns (using Python and Jupyter Notebook notebooks).
* **Web Development:** Presents a user-friendly interface for interacting with the application (built with JavaScript and HTML/CSS).
* **Backend:** Manages user registration, authentication, and data persistence (implemented using a server-side framework like Node.js with Express).
* **Database:** Stores user data securely (likely a database like MongoDB or PostgreSQL).

**Key Features:**

* **Prediction:** Leverages machine learning models to provide insights into mental health.
* **Data Tracking:** Enables users to record and monitor their health trends over time.
* **Visualization:** Offers clear and informative visualizations to help understand personal health data.
* **User Management:** Allows users to register, log in, and securely manage their health information.

**Getting Started**

1. **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your system.
2. **Clone the Repository:** Use `git clone https://github.com/RajaBabu15/Health-Tracker-Web-Application.git` to clone this repository.
3. **Install Dependencies:** Navigate to the project directory and run `npm install` (or `yarn install`) to install the required dependencies.
4. **Database Setup:** Configure your database connection details in the `server/db/conn.js` file.
5. **Run the Application:** Start the server using `npm start` (or `yarn start`). The application will typically be accessible at http://localhost:3000/ (the exact port may vary).

**Machine Learning Model (Optional)**

* This project may include a pre-trained machine learning model for mental health prediction (stored in `model.pkl`).
* The notebooks (`apii.ipynb` and `mental_health.ipynb`) might contain code for training or evaluating the model.
* Refer to the notebooks for specific instructions on running and interpreting the model.
