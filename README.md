## Introduction
The Health Tracker Web Application is a comprehensive tool designed to help users monitor and improve their mental health. It leverages machine learning models to provide insights and predictions based on user data.

## Features
- User-friendly web interface for tracking mental health metrics
- Machine learning models for predicting mental health outcomes
- API for integration with other applications
- Interactive visualizations and reports

## Installation
To run this application locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Health-Tracker-Web-Application.git
    cd Health-Tracker-Web-Application
    ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment:**
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install the dependencies:**
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Set up the configuration:**
    Ensure the configuration settings in `config/config.py` are correct.

5. **Run the application:**
    ```sh
    python app.py
    ```

## Usage
Once the application is running, you can access it via `http://localhost:5000` in your web browser.

### Using the Jupyter Notebooks
To use the Jupyter notebooks for data processing and model training:
1. Navigate to the `notebooks` directory.
2. Run the Jupyter notebook server:
    ```sh
    jupyter notebook
    ```
3. Open `mental_health.ipynb` to explore and execute the notebook cells.

## Models
The application uses several machine learning models to predict mental health outcomes. The models are trained and tuned using the hyperparameters specified in the code. The models include:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- K-Neighbors Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- AdaBoost Classifier
- Gradient Boosting Classifier
- XGBoost Classifier

## API Endpoints
The application provides several API endpoints for interacting with the models and retrieving data. Detailed documentation for these endpoints is available in the `server/api.py` file.
