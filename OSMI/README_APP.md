# 🧠 OSMI Mental Health Risk Predictor

A user-friendly Streamlit web application that predicts the likelihood of seeking mental health treatment based on workplace and personal factors.

## 🌟 Features

- **Interactive Web Interface**: Easy-to-use form with comprehensive questions
- **Real-time Predictions**: Get instant predictions using trained machine learning models
- **Risk Assessment**: Clear risk level categorization (Very Low, Low, Medium, High, Very High)
- **Visual Results**: Beautiful gauge charts and risk level indicators
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Tailored suggestions based on predicted risk level
- **Model Transparency**: View model performance metrics and training details

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Trained model files (generated by running `train_models.py`)

### Installation

1. **Install required packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements_app.txt
   ```

2. **Ensure model files exist:**
   Make sure you have trained the model first:
   ```bash
   python src/modeling/train_models.py
   ```

### Running the App

**Option 1: Use the launcher script (Recommended)**
```bash
python run_app.py
```

**Option 2: Direct Streamlit command**
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The app will open in your default web browser at `http://localhost:8501`

## 📋 How to Use

1. **Fill out the questionnaire**: Answer questions about your employment, workplace culture, and mental health resources
2. **Click "Predict Treatment Likelihood"**: Get your prediction instantly
3. **Review results**: See your risk level, probability percentage, and personalized recommendations
4. **Follow recommendations**: Use the suggested actions based on your risk level

## 🎯 Risk Levels

- **🟢 Very Low (0-20%)**: Continue current wellness practices
- **🟡 Low (20-34%)**: Maintain wellness, explore resources
- **🟠 Medium (34-60%)**: Consider professional check-in, use EAP
- **🔴 High (60-80%)**: Seek mental health support soon
- **⚫ Very High (80-100%)**: Seek immediate mental health support

## 📊 Model Information

- **Model Type**: Calibrated LightGBM Classifier
- **Training Data**: OSMI (Open Sourcing Mental Illness) Mental Health Survey

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Model files not found?**
- Run `python src/modeling/train_models.py` to train the model first

**Missing packages?**
- Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements_app.txt`

**App won't start?**
- Use the launcher script: `python run_app.py` (it includes automatic checks)

**Prediction errors?**
- Make sure all required questions are answered
- Check that model files are properly loaded

## 📈 Future Enhancements

- [ ] Add model explainability features (SHAP values)
- [ ] Include confidence intervals for predictions  
- [ ] Add batch prediction capability
- [ ] Implement user feedback collection
- [ ] Add data export functionality
- [ ] Multi-language support

## 📝 Data Source

This application uses data from the [Open Sourcing Mental Illness (OSMI)](https://osmihelp.org/) survey, which aims to measure attitudes towards mental health and frequency of mental health disorders in the tech workplace.
